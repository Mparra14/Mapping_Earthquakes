# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Objective
In this project, we were tasked to use a new JavaScript library called Leaflet. This particular library lets you create interactive maps on the page created. We were able to create a code to display a map that would have multiple layers such as street view, or satallite view that can be toggled with. In this particular project we were dealing with earthquake data, so we had to create overlays in the map that would show the tectonic plates, recent earthquakes, and major earthquakes. We were able to connect our Javascript code to current websites that hold that information using the D3 library. In order to make multiple points, such as earthquakes, we had to use geoJASON data to create this map.
